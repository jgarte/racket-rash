 ;; These are somewhat generalized implementations of “process substitution”, IE <() and >() from bash.  They use named pipes (not file descriptors of inner pipelines, which some shells do) but allow arbitrary racket code, not just pipelines.  Something more analogous to <() and >() is a simple macro away.  But <() isn't very common, and I'm not sure it needs a particularly terse notation.  >() is crazy, I've never used it, and it probably doesn't work like many people expect since programs that take an output file usually replace rather than append to the file.

What are some good (or at least interesting) substitution ideas?
• “process substitution”, IE sub-pipeline output to named pipe substitution, a la <() and >() in Bash and friends.
• pipeline stdout substitution (a la `$()` in bash, already covered effectively with #{}, though, since it needs no cleanup.)
• closure substitution (idea originally from Alexis King -- give the subprocess the name of a temporary script that opens a socket to a fresh thread in the rash script that executes the given procedure on the argv and stdin, setting `current-output-port` and `current-error-port` to something that communicates over the socket).
• temporary file substitution (IE just make a temporary file, pass the name of that file, then clean it up when the pipeline is over).
• temporary directory substitution.
• temporary file system substitution (IE mount a file system at a temporary directory path, pass that path to the pipeline, umount after pipeline exit.  This could actually be useful given various FUSE programmatic file systems.)
• user/group substitution (IE as root, create a temporary user/group and pass its UID/GID to the process).  Eg. you could pass this to `sudo` to run a command as a fresh user.  I don't know why you would want to do this, though.
• http url substitution using the web server (this one is really dumb, but, hey, it's doable).
• temporary virtual block file substitution
• temporary symlink substitution
• host-name/ip-address substitution (to a temporary virtual machine, maybe?)
• Any other resource that you might pass a reference of to a subprocess.
